## Emotion Detection using NLP
So after analysing emotion of people based on their photos, I aspired to determine emotion of people based on their messages as well.

# Problem Statement
Given a sentence by the user we have to predict the emotion relevant to it.

What is the sentiment of user as inferred from that comment?

# Dataset
Dataset has 5 labels: joy, sad, anger, fear, and neutral. The texts mainly consist of short messages and dialog utterances.
